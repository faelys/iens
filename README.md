This application is a TUI for managing a database of links to read
and generating ATOM feeds from user-provided tags and description.

It is built around the [CHICKEN Scheme](https://call-cc.org/)
interpreter, and depends on [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html),
[lowdown](ehttps://bitbucket.org/DerGuteMoritz/lowdown),
and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html).
